**Project:** Dodging Obstacles: From Bubbles to Planets

Following the theme of SCALE, I will be attempting to create
a survival game, in which the player will have to control their 
character and dodge all the projectiles and obstacles for 60 seconds. 
After successfully staying safe for 60 seconds, the player will move on
to different levels, in which they will be dodging obstacles and 
projectiles of various scales. This is what I envision the project to be
by the end of phase 3. 

### Phase 1
 - Creating the character
 - Setting character movement (with arrow keys)
 - Creating the various obstacles
 - Setting the size and movement of obstacles
 - Creating a timer
 - Determining how many levels I need (enough to create a sense of scale)

### Phase 2
 - Figuring out how to create "levels"
 - Creating collision interactions between objects and character
 - Determining interactions with the screen border

### Phase 3
 - Connecting the levels together
 - Creating win and lose screens
 - Limiting number of items on screen
 - Consider adding additional features
   - Powerups
   - More characters
   - Special levels
 - Tidying up look of game
