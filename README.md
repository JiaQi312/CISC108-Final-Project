**Project:** Dodging Obstacles: From Bubbles to Planets

Following the theme of SCALE, I will be attempting to create
a survival game, in which the player will have to control their 
character and dodge all the projectiles and obstacles for 30 seconds. 
After successfully staying safe for 30 seconds, the player will move on
to different levels, in which they will be dodging obstacles and 
projectiles of various scales. This is what I envision the project to be
by the end of phase 3. 

### Phase 1: Figuring things out
 - [x] Creating the character
 - [x] Setting character movement (with arrow keys)
 - [x] Creating a timer
 - [x] Determining how many levels I need (Currently: 5)
 - [x] Creating a Level
   - Creating obstacle
     - [x] Decide where obstacle spawns
     - [x] Size of obstacle
     - [x] Speed of obstacle
     - [x] Direction of obstacle
     - [x] Obstacle - wall interactions
   - [x] Creating collision interactions between objects and character
     - [x] Lose screen

### Phase 2: "Scaling" Up
 - [x] Repeating steps under creating a level (4 times)
   - [x] Level 2
   - [x] Level 3
   - [x] Level 4
   - [x] Level 5
 - [x] Connecting levels together (want to use the timer)
