**Project:** Dodging Dangerous Deterrents

Dodging compounding obstacles of various scales, speeds, and sizes

### About
Following the theme of SCALE, I will be attempting to create
a game in which the player will control a character and dodge 
projectiles and obstacles (of increasing scales) on screen for 30 seconds.
After successfully staying safe for 30 seconds, the player will move on to 
different levels, in which additional obstacles will be added on top of the 
already existing obstacles. This continues until the player reaches the final 
phase and wins the game by reaching the end. 

### Preview: (will insert video here)

### Instructions:
 - Dodge the obstacles
 - Control character with the arrow keys
